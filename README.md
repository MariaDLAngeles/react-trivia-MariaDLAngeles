# React Trivia Game

This project was completed as part of Momentum Learning's Software Engineering Program. It has been forked from an existing repository and edited for clarity.

## Project Descriptions and Requirements from Momentum Learning Course

For this project, you will use React to build a trivia game powered by the Open Trivia Database.

This project does not include any wireframes: you will have to design the game yourself.

One way to implement this is to present the user with a list of categories. A user can choose a category, and then answer questions within that category. That's not the only way you could do this; you're welcome to be creative.

## Skills you're building in this project
Doing this project, you will...

+ Plan and build an application that needs multiple components
+ Gain more experience using state in React
+ Fetch data from a third-party API and use it in your React application
+ Understand React data flow
+ Definition of Done: what the project should do and look like when it is finished
+ This list is not necessarily in the order in which you should build these parts of the application.

When the application loads, a user can see a list of possible trivia categories so that they can choose one to start a quiz in that category.
A user can select a category and start a quiz in that category. A quiz should have at least 10 questions in it.
A quiz shows the user one question at a time, with its possible answers shown in a random order so that the correct answer isn't in the same place every time.
A user can select an answer to a question and can see some visual feedback that they selected an answer.
The user progresses through each question in the category, choosing their answer, until they reach the end of the questions.
After a user has answered all the questions in a category, they can see how many questions they answered correctly, or some kind of score. Optionally, show them which questions they got right and which ones they got wrong.
A user can go back to the list of categories and start a new quiz in a different category.

##Project Requirements
+ The application makes use of 3 or more components.
+ The application has two or more "screens." In a traditional web application, we'd think of these as different pages.
+ The application uses React's state to manage data.
+ The application uses the Open Trivia Database API.
+ The application is styled in a way that enhances its usability and functionality.
+ The application includes at least one one spicy option from the list.
+ You can explain how your application works and why you made the design decisions you did.
